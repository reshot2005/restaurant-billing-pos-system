# Fixed Project - Restaurant Billing Management App (Cleaned)

## What I changed
- Implemented a robust `login` function with:
  - Primary attempt to call configured API endpoint.
  - Local fallback using hardcoded credentials for development (`admin/password123`, `cashier/cashier123`).
  - Friendly error messages and consistent localStorage handling.
- Improved Login form error handling and display.
- Added an inspection report `INSPECTION_REPORT.txt`.

## How to run locally
1. Ensure Node.js (>=18) and npm are installed.
2. From the project root:
```bash
cd project
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open the app at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default) or as shown in terminal.

## Notes / Next steps
- Replace fallback credentials and token logic with a proper backend authentication (OAuth / JWT).
- Inspect `src/components/Auth/AuthContext.tsx` around the `API_URL` constant â€” currently it uses `projectId` from `utils/supabase/info`. Confirm the Supabase setup or replace with your real API base URL.
- Run `npm audit` and update dependencies as needed.
